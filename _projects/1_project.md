The [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/) project hosts datasets that are paired with rich documentation, data essays, and teaching resources, all of which draw on context and humanities perspectives and methods.  We provide models for responsible data curation, documentation, story-telling, and analysis.

Our project was supported by a Responsible Computing Challenge (2023-2024). The Responsible Computing Challenge is a partnership between Mozilla, Omidyar Network, Schmidt Futures, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Mellon Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
