The [AI for Humanists project](https://aiforhumanists.com/) (formerly the BERT for Humanists project) is developing resources to inform, empower, and inspire humanities scholars to use LLMs in their disciplines in creative new ways.

We seek to provide an intellectual framework for understanding and evaluating LLMs so that humanists may be positioned to make use of — and to critique — these important new computational language technologies.

The AI for Humanists project was generously supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2021 and 2023.
